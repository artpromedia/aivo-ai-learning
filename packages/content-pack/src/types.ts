/**
 * Content-pack schema (§5 Content infrastructure, v2.1 §9.3 Build).
 *
 * A "content pack" is a sealed, versioned bundle of authored learning
 * activities for a specific (subject, gradeBand) slice — e.g. the
 * "K-Math-Fall-2026" pack. Packs are produced by the (future) admin CMS
 * and consumed by tutor-runtime as bootstrap scaffolding for
 * `planSession()` and as seed material for live LLM generation.
 *
 * AIVO's runtime principle is *generate live, don't pre-author* — packs
 * are not the primary source of activities at session time. They cover
 * cold-start, offline, and budget-capped degraded states, and give the
 * generator high-quality exemplars to imitate.
 *
 * Note: the `FALLBACK_ACTIVITIES` constant in
 * apps/web/src/components/discovery/useDiscoveryEngine.ts is a separate,
 * intentionally minimal client-side safety net for the no-token /
 * ai-svc-unreachable case. It is *not* superseded by this package.
 *
 * Each `Activity` references a `Skill` from `@aivo/skill-graphs` so the
 * pack can be checked for coverage gaps before publish.
