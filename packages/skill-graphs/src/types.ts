/**
 * Skill-graph schema (§5 Content infrastructure, v2.1).
 *
 * A skill graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of curriculum skills,
 * each anchored to one or more standards-framework codes (e.g. CCSS-Math,
 * NGSS, WIDA). Edges encode prerequisites: an edge `A -> B` means a learner
 * is expected to have mastered A before encountering B.
 *
 * This replaces brain-svc's LLM-synthesized-on-demand curriculum graph with
 * a static, versionable, auditable artifact.
