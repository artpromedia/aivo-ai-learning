/**
 * Functioning-level content transforms (§9.3 Extract 4–6w).
 *
 * The "functioning level" ladder in `@aivo/brand` (STANDARD → SUPPORTED →
 * LOW_VERBAL → NON_VERBAL → PRE_SYMBOLIC) describes how a learner is
 * expected to access content. Authoring teams produce a *single* pack at
 * STANDARD (§5 Content infrastructure) and the runtime transforms each
 * activity down the ladder for learners who need scaffolding, picture
 * support, switch-scan, or pre-symbolic cause-and-effect substitutes.
 *
 * Each transform is a pure function `Activity → Activity` so transforms
 * are deterministic, composable, and trivially testable.
 *
 * The five canonical levels are:
 *
 *   STANDARD     — render the activity as authored
 *   SUPPORTED    — add scaffolding cues + reduce simultaneous choices
 *   LOW_VERBAL   — replace prose with picture choices, reduce text
 *   NON_VERBAL   — switch-scannable, no expressive-speech requirement
 *   PRE_SYMBOLIC — cause-and-effect tap with observational scoring
