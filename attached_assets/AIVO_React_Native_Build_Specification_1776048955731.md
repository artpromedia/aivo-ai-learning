# AIVO Learning — React Native Mobile App Build Specification

## What You Are Building

A React Native (Expo) mobile app at `apps/mobile` inside the existing AIVO pnpm + Turborepo monorepo. The app achieves full feature parity with the React 19 + Next.js 15 web app at `apps/web` across 5 user roles: Parent, Learner, Teacher, Caregiver, and Therapist. Platform Admin and District Admin are web-only roles. The app shares TypeScript types, API clients, event schemas, business logic, and design tokens directly from the monorepo's 14 shared packages. The learner experience is built on a GPU-accelerated Stage renderer using `@shopify/react-native-skia`, not a chat interface and not a WebView.

---

## The Monorepo Context

The existing monorepo is 72% TypeScript with:

- 13 TypeScript microservices (Fastify) + 2 Python microservices (FastAPI)
- A React 19 + Next.js 15 web app at `apps/web` with TailwindCSS 4 and shadcn/ui
- 14 shared packages in `packages/`
- pnpm workspaces + Turborepo for builds
- NATS JetStream event bus, PostgreSQL 16 with RLS, Redis 7

The mobile app plugs into this monorepo as another `apps/` entry. It does not duplicate types, clients, or business logic. It imports them.

## Technical Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Expo SDK 52+ (managed workflow) |
| Navigation | Expo Router (file-based, mirrors Next.js routing) |
| Server State | TanStack Query v5 (caching, background refetch, offline) |
| Local State | Zustand (UI state, auth state, sensory profile context) |
| HTTP Clients | `@aivo/brain-client`, `@aivo/ai-client`, `@aivo/tutor-client` (direct monorepo import) |
| Streaming | `react-native-sse` polyfill (SSE for tutor sessions) |
| GPU Rendering | `@shopify/react-native-skia` (Stage canvas, Brain visualization) |
| Animations | `react-native-reanimated` v3 (UI thread worklets) + `lottie-react-native` (tutor characters) |
| Gestures | `react-native-gesture-handler` (drag-and-drop, swipe, pan) |
| Haptics | `expo-haptics` (correct/incorrect feedback, drag snap, celebrations) |
| Audio | `expo-av` (TTS playback, sound effects, ambient) + `expo-speech` (fallback TTS) |
| Camera | `expo-camera` + `expo-image-picker` (homework capture, IEP photo) |
| Files | `expo-file-system` + `expo-document-picker` (PDF upload) |
| Offline DB | `expo-sqlite` (Brain cache, lesson cache, sync queue) |
| Secure Storage | `expo-secure-store` (JWT, refresh tokens, learner PIN) |
| Push | `expo-notifications` + FCM (Android) + APNs (iOS) |
| Biometrics | `expo-local-authentication` (Face ID / Touch ID for parent) |
| i18n | `i18next` + `react-i18next` (19 namespaces, ~2050 keys, matches web) |
| Design Tokens | `@aivo/brand` (direct import, same tokens as web) |
| Testing | Jest + React Native Testing Library (unit/component) + Detox (E2E) |
| OTA Updates | EAS Update (channels: production, staging, preview) |

## Package Sharing

### Direct Imports (Zero Changes)

These packages are pure TypeScript with no DOM or Node dependencies. Import them in the mobile app exactly as the web app does via `workspace:*` in `package.json`:

| Package | What It Provides |
|---------|-----------------|
| `@aivo/brand` | Color tokens (purple, teal, navy), gradients, fonts, radius, shadows |
| `@aivo/events` | Zod-typed NATS event definitions (all event payloads as TS types) |
| `@aivo/brain-client` | Type-safe HTTP client for brain-svc (uses fetch, works in RN) |
| `@aivo/ai-client` | Type-safe HTTP client for ai-svc (uses fetch) |
| `@aivo/tutor-client` | Type-safe HTTP client for tutor-svc (uses fetch) |
| `@aivo/auth` | JWT decode, role enums, guard logic, session types |
| `@aivo/feature-flags` | Feature flag client (uses fetch) |
| `@aivo/iep-parser` | IEP document parsing type definitions |
| `@aivo/functioning-levels` | Functioning level enum, routing logic, content generation rules |

### New Package: @aivo/mobile-ui

Create `packages/mobile-ui`. This package provides React Native components that implement the same visual language as the web `@aivo/ui` components but using RN primitives (`View`, `Text`, `Pressable`) instead of DOM elements (`div`, `span`, `button`). It imports `@aivo/brand` tokens directly for all colors, spacing, radius, and shadows.

### Not Used on Mobile

| Package | Why |
|---------|-----|
| `@aivo/ui` | React DOM components, cannot render in RN |
| `@aivo/security` | CSRF not applicable (token auth only), rate limiting is server-side |
| `@aivo/db` | Type exports importable, but no Drizzle DB connection on mobile |
| `@aivo/nats` | No direct NATS connection from mobile, events consumed via API |
| `@enterprise-email/aivolearning-email` | Email sent server-side only |

## Authentication

### Parent Login

Email/password form or Google/Apple OAuth via `expo-auth-session`. On success, store JWT in `expo-secure-store` under key `aivo_access_token`, refresh token under `aivo_refresh_token`. Decode role from JWT payload. Navigate to `/(parent)/`. On subsequent launches, check stored token validity. If valid, skip login. If expired, attempt silent refresh via refresh token endpoint. If refresh fails, show login. Optional biometric unlock: after first successful login, offer "Enable Face ID / Touch ID." Store a biometric flag. On next launch, prompt biometric before reading stored token.

### Learner PIN Login

Full-screen PIN pad using the Stage visual language. AIVO warm purple background (#1A1A2E). Large circular number buttons (80px diameter, `@aivo/brand` purple fill, white text, Nunito ExtraBold). Haptic feedback on each tap (`expo-haptics` light impact). PIN displayed as filled dots (not numbers, for privacy). On correct PIN, the learner's avatar does a wave animation and the app navigates to `/(learner)/`. On incorrect PIN, buttons shake gently (Reanimated spring), dots turn red briefly, and a warm audio cue plays. After 5 failed attempts, show "Ask a parent for help." PIN is stored encrypted in `expo-secure-store`. No biometric for learner accounts (COPPA).

### Teacher / Caregiver / Therapist Login

Email/password or school SSO (Clever/ClassLink) via `expo-auth-session` custom scheme redirect. Same JWT storage pattern as parent. Role decoded from token determines which layout group loads.

### Role-Based Shell Routing

The root `_layout.tsx` reads the authenticated role and renders the appropriate layout group. Each group `(parent)`, `(learner)`, `(teacher)`, `(caregiver)`, `(therapist)` has its own `_layout.tsx` defining the bottom tab navigator with role-specific tabs, header configuration, and guard middleware that redirects if the user's role does not match. Platform Admin and District Admin roles are redirected to the web app.

### Token Refresh

A background interval (14 minutes) calls the refresh endpoint. If the app is backgrounded, the refresh runs on next foreground via `AppState` listener. All API calls via `@aivo/brain-client` and other shared clients include an auth interceptor that retries with a fresh token on 401.

```

The Skia canvas is the visual rendering engine. React Native Views overlaid on top handle touch interaction and accessibility. This split ensures: GPU-accelerated smooth visuals AND full VoiceOver/TalkBack accessibility on interactive elements.

### Beat Format (Shared with Web)

The Stage consumes the same JSON beat format that the web app uses. ai-svc generates beats. Both web (Pixi.js) and mobile (Skia) renderers interpret the same data:

```typescript
interface StageBeat {
  id: string;
  visual: {
    background: string;
    elements: StageElement[];
    tutorState: 'idle' | 'speaking' | 'pointing' | 'celebrating' | 'thinking' | 'encouraging';
    tutorTarget?: string;
  };
  audio: {
    narration: string;
    soundEffect?: string;
    ambient?: string;
  };
  interaction: {
    type: 'tap' | 'drag' | 'speak' | 'match' | 'draw' | 'yesno';
    options: InteractionOption[];
    correctIds: string[];
    hintAfter?: number;
  };
  sensory: {
    motionIntensity: number;
    visualComplexity: number;
    audioPriority: boolean;
  };
  adaptive: {
    nextOnCorrect: string;
    nextOnIncorrect: string;
    implicitSignals: string[];
  };
}
```

Import the beat type from a shared location (add to `@aivo/events` or create `@aivo/stage-types`). Both renderers consume it. Content is authored once.

### SensoryAdapter

A React context provider that wraps the Stage. On mount, fetches `sensoryProfile` from `@aivo/brain-client`. All child components read sensory parameters from context and adjust rendering:

- Visual hyper-sensitivity: Skia `ColorFilter.matrix()` desaturation at 30%, cap brightness, max 3 on-screen elements, soft shadows, animation durations doubled
- Visual hypo-sensitivity: contrast filter applied, bold outlines (stroke width 3), interactive elements pulse via Reanimated `withRepeat`
- Motion sensitivity: particle effects disabled, Reanimated durations set to 0 (instant), Lottie idle animations paused, slide transitions replaced with opacity fades
- Auditory hyper-sensitivity: `expo-av` volume at 60%, no sudden sound effects, gradual fades
- Auditory hypo-sensitivity: volume at 120%, secondary chime before instructions, slower speech rate
- Tactile off: all `expo-haptics` calls become no-ops
- Cognitive load high: fewer elements per screen, 10-second breathing animation between activities, simpler narration

### Tutor Characters

14 Lottie JSON files, one per tutor. Each file contains named animation segments: `idle`, `speaking`, `pointing_left`, `pointing_right`, `celebrating`, `thinking`, `encouraging`, `transitioning`. A `TutorStateMachine` class manages transitions:

```typescript
class TutorStateMachine {
  currentState: TutorAnimState;
  transition(to: TutorAnimState, target?: string): void;
  // Plays the Lottie segment for the new state
  // If 'pointing', positions the tutor's gesture toward the target element
}
```

Tutor assets are loaded lazily. Only the active session's tutor is loaded (~300KB). Pre-cache the learner's subscribed tutors on app install.

### Haptic Patterns

```typescript
// lib/haptics.ts
import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics';

export const haptic = {
  tap:       () => Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light),
  dragSnap:  () => Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium),
  correct:   () => Haptics.notificationAsync(Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Success),
  incorrect: () => Haptics.notificationAsync(Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Warning),
  celebrate: () => Haptics.notificationAsync(Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Success),
  pinTap:    () => Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light),
};
// All calls filtered through useSensory() — if tactile === 'off', these become no-ops
```

### Functioning-Level Response Zone Adaptations

Import `@aivo/functioning-levels` for all rules:

| Level | Response Zone Behavior |
|-------|----------------------|
| STANDARD | 4 answer cards (48px touch targets), drag-and-drop, voice, text input, drawing |
| SUPPORTED | 3 answer cards (56px), auto-play audio labels, 1.5x response timeout, larger drag targets |
| LOW_VERBAL | 2 answer cards covering 40% of screen each, no text anywhere, audio-primary, touch-anywhere-to-select, celebration on every interaction |
| NON_VERBAL (switch) | 2 options highlight alternately via Reanimated withRepeat (configurable dwell 1.5-3s), iOS Switch Control / Android Switch Access triggers selection |
| NON_VERBAL (partner) | Facilitator overlay shows instructions, child screen shows 2 simplified visuals, facilitator taps response recording buttons |
| PRE_SYMBOLIC | No Stage. Parent sees activity guides and observational checklists in their dashboard. |

## Brain Visualization (Skia)

The Brain cross-section, grade ladders, accommodation ring, goal paths, and Building Sequence are all rendered using `@shopify/react-native-skia`.

### Grade Ladder Component

A vertical Skia path with grade markers as small horizontal lines. The enrolled grade flag at the top. A colored fill from bottom to the child's current level (animated with Reanimated shared values driving Skia path clip). The marker glows at the current level. Stepping stones between current and target are drawn as small nodes on the path with skill labels rendered as Skia text.

After sessions, when mastery updates arrive, the marker position (a Reanimated shared value) animates upward to the new level. This animation is visible whenever the learner or parent views the Brain.

### Building Sequence (Parent Onboarding)

The 6-stage clone visualization plays on the parent's screen during onboarding. All 6 stages are rendered in the same Skia canvas: template blueprint descends, compartments fill with grade ladders showing per-domain functioning levels, accommodation ring lights up with evidence labels, goal paths populate with stepping stones and IEP star pins, activation pulse connects everything, tutor connections extend outward with per-subject delivery levels. Followed by the three-button decision: Approve / Add Context and Rebuild / Start Over.

## Offline Architecture

### SQLite Schema (expo-sqlite)

```sql
-- Brain snapshot cache
brain_cache (
  learner_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  brain_state TEXT NOT NULL,          -- JSON string of full Brain context
  fetched_at INTEGER NOT NULL         -- Unix timestamp
);

-- Pre-fetched lesson beats
lesson_cache (
  lesson_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  beats TEXT NOT NULL,                -- JSON array of StageBeat objects
  audio_paths TEXT,                   -- JSON array of local file paths for TTS
  cached_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Offline interaction queue
sync_queue (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  event_type TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 'session.completed', 'xp.awarded', etc.
  payload TEXT NOT NULL,              -- JSON event payload
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  synced INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Gamification cache
gamification_cache (
  learner_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  xp INTEGER, level INTEGER, coins INTEGER, gems INTEGER,
  streak_days INTEGER, streak_frozen INTEGER,
  badges TEXT,                        -- JSON array
  updated_at INTEGER
);
```

### Sync Behavior

**Going offline:** TanStack Query's `networkMode: 'offlineFirst'` serves cached Brain context and gamification data. Up to 10 pre-fetched lesson beat sequences available in `lesson_cache`. TTS audio files stored via `expo-file-system`.

**While offline:** Learner completes cached lessons. All interactions (session completions, XP awards, streak updates) written to `sync_queue` with `synced: 0`. Brain context comes from `brain_cache`. No live tutor sessions (require SSE streaming). No homework upload (requires Vision AI). No multiplayer.

**Coming back online:** `NetInfo` detects connectivity. `drainSyncQueue()` reads all `synced: 0` entries, posts each to the server in chronological order, marks `synced: 1` on success. TanStack Query refetches Brain context (server is authoritative, replaces cache). Fresh lessons pre-fetched for next offline period.

## Push Notifications

Register device token with comms-svc on login via `expo-notifications`.

| Notification | NATS Trigger | Deep Link |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Brain recommendation | `brain.recommendation.created` | `/(parent)/recommendations` |
| Tutor activated | `tutor.addon.activated` | `/(parent)/tutors` |
| IEP goal met | `brain.iep_goal.met` | `/(parent)/brain/[childId]` |
| Streak broken | `engagement.streak.broken` | `/(learner)/gamification` |
| Badge earned | `engagement.badge.awarded` | `/(learner)/badges` |
| Homework ready | `homework.processed` | `/(learner)/homework` |
| Weekly digest | Weekly cron | `/(parent)/progress/[childId]` |
| Level change | `brain.functioning_level.changed` | `/(parent)/brain/[childId]` |

Deep links handled in root `_layout.tsx` via Expo Router's `useURL()` hook.

---

## Camera and File Upload

### Homework Photo Capture

`/(learner)/homework`: Open `expo-camera` with overlay guide frame ("Center your homework"). 80px purple capture button with haptic. Preview with "Use Photo" / "Retake." On confirm, upload via `@aivo/ai-client` multipart endpoint. Processing animation (tutor character "reading" the page). Results: extracted problems as interactive `AnswerCard` components.

### IEP Document Upload

`/(parent)/onboard` or `/(parent)/iep/[childId]`: `expo-document-picker` for PDF, `expo-camera` for photo of printed document. Upload to assessment-svc. Processing animation. Parsed fields displayed for parent confirmation (Confirm / Edit / Skip).

## Design System: @aivo/mobile-ui

### Token Consumption

```typescript
import { tokens } from '@aivo/brand';

export const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: tokens.colors.purple[500],     // #915EE3
    primaryDark: tokens.colors.purple[600],  // #7C3AED
    secondary: tokens.colors.teal[400],      // #35CBDA
    navy: tokens.colors.navy,                // #1A1A2E
    background: '#FFFBF7',
    card: '#FFFFFF',
    success: tokens.colors.success,
    warning: tokens.colors.warning,
    error: tokens.colors.error,
  },
  spacing: { xs: 4, sm: 8, md: 16, lg: 24, xl: 32 },
  radius: tokens.radius,
  shadows: tokens.shadows,
  fonts: { heading: 'Nunito-ExtraBold', body: 'Nunito-Regular', mono: 'JetBrainsMono-Regular' },
};
```

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `AivoButton` | Pressable with Reanimated scale, haptic on press, rounded-2xl, purple gradient or outline variants |
| `AivoCard` | View with card shadow, rounded-3xl, warm white background |
| `AivoHeader` | `expo-linear-gradient` purple gradient with logo |
| `StatCard` | Animated stat number (Reanimated `withTiming` on value change) |
| `BrainVisualization` | Skia canvas rendering cross-section, grade ladders, accommodation ring |
| `GradeLadder` | Skia vertical path with Reanimated-driven marker position |
| `TutorCard` | Tutor avatar image, persona name, subject, subscribe/launch button |
| `XPBar` | Reanimated width animation with purple gradient fill |
| `StreakFlame` | Lottie flame, day count overlay |
| `BadgeIcon` | Image with rarity-colored border, sparkle Lottie on first reveal |
| `AnswerCard` | Large touchable, illustration, haptic feedback, correct/incorrect Reanimated animation |
| `DragTarget` | Gesture handler drop zone, snap Reanimated spring, haptic on drop |
| `MicButton` | Pulsing Reanimated ring, expo-av recording, Whisper STT via API |
| `DrawCanvas` | Skia touch drawing surface, thick forgiving lines |
| `EmptyState` | Illustration + message + CTA button |

Every interactive component accepts sensory context and adapts (touch target size, animation intensity, haptic on/off).

---

## Accessibility

### VoiceOver / TalkBack

Every interactive element has `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityRole`, and `accessibilityHint`. Screen content is described in reading order. The Stage's Skia canvas is invisible to screen readers; all interactive elements are RN Views overlaid on the canvas with full accessibility attributes. When the tutor speaks, a live region announcement is posted via `AccessibilityInfo.announceForAccessibility()`.

### Switch Access

The Response Zone's answer cards are focusable in sequence. iOS Switch Control and Android Switch Access navigate between cards using the system's built-in scanning. The Stage does not interfere with system switch scanning because interactive elements are native RN Views, not canvas-drawn.

For the NON_VERBAL switch-scan mode (AIVO's custom in-app scanning), the app implements its own highlight loop: a Reanimated-driven glowing border cycles between the 2 answer options at a configurable speed. The learner's external switch triggers a `keyDown` event that the app listens for via `Keyboard` API or accessibility action.

### Dynamic Type

All text uses RN `Text` component with `allowFontScaling={true}`. Layouts use flexbox so they reflow at larger sizes. The Stage's Skia-rendered text uses a font size multiplied by `PixelRatio.getFontScale()`.

### Reduced Motion

On mount, check `AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled`. If true, all Reanimated animations use `withTiming({ duration: 0 })`, Lottie autoPlay is disabled (show static frame), and Skia particle effects are replaced with static glows.

## What This App Is

This is a fully native React Native application that shares TypeScript types, API clients, and business logic with the web app through the monorepo. It serves 5 user roles with dedicated screen sets: Parents (14 screens including Brain visualization, recommendation inbox, co-learning, and the Building Sequence), Learners (12 screens including The Stage, 14 tutor sessions, homework helper, and full gamification), Teachers (6 screens including lesson plan generator), Caregivers (10 screens including Brain summary, accommodations, IEP goals, session logs, observation submission, and progress trends), and Therapists (5 screens including HIPAA-scoped Brain and insurance-formatted reports). Platform Admin and District Admin are web-only roles. All 14 AI tutors (Nova, Sage, Spark, Chrono, Pixel, Echo, Harmony, Atlas, Cadence, Vigor, Lingua, Forge, Compass, Muse) are fully supported with distinct Lottie personas, SSE streaming, and Stage rendering. The Stage is native Skia. The tutor characters are native Lottie. The haptics are native. The offline storage is native SQLite. The camera is native. The push notifications are native. It imports 9 shared packages directly from the monorepo with zero reimplementation. Every feature the web app has for these 5 roles, the mobile app has. Where mobile can do things the web cannot, it does.
