/**
 * Parent Assessment — question bank
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Models the 8-section framework documented in
 * `attached_assets/Pasted--Aivo-Parent-Assessment-Design-Framework-...txt`.
 *
 * Design principles encoded here:
 *  • Strengths-first: Section 2 (Strengths/Interests/Motivations) appears
 *    before Section 3 (Diagnoses/Medical) and the 4-x sub-modules.
 *  • Observable behaviour only — no clinical jargon. Frequency Likerts use
 *    Never/Rarely/Sometimes/Often/Always plus a mandatory "Not sure" escape.
 *  • Almost everything is soft-required ("I'd rather not say" implicitly via
 *    the `required: false` default). Only DOB and consent are hard-required.
 *  • The MVP cut from framework §9 is shipped here: Sections 0/1/2 in full,
 *    3-lite, 4a/4b/4g, 5 + access mini-block, 6, 7. Sensory/Motor/Adaptive/
 *    Behavior-Regulation sub-modules (4c-4f) are deferred to v2.
 *
 * The legacy heuristic in `services/assessment-svc/src/services/level-router.ts`
 * still keys off five compat IDs (communicationMode, deviceInteraction,
 * responseMethod, attentionSpan, diagnoses) — those question IDs are kept
 * stable below and re-mapped to their new section homes (see COMPAT_IDS).
