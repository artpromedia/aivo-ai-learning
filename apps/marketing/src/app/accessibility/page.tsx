We treat accessibility as a continuous responsibility — not a one-time project — and we hold ourselves to the same access standards on every release.",
            "Our commitment is grounded in three principles. First, accessibility is a civil right and a precondition for the inclusive education we exist to provide. Second, accessibility is a design discipline, not a remediation step; we plan for it from the earliest sketches of every feature. Third, accessibility is a shared responsibility across product, engineering, design, content, and quality engineering, and every AIVO team member is accountable for the accessibility of the work they ship.",

We aim for substantial conformance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA across the website, the web application, the iOS and Android applications, and the educational content we author.",
