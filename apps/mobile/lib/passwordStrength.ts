/**
 * Client-side password strength estimator shared by the mobile auth flows.
 *
 * Used by the forced-change-password screen (`change-password.tsx`) and the
 * email-link reset screen (`reset-password.tsx`). Mirrors the simple
 * heuristic on `apps/web/src/app/reset-password/page.tsx` so the two
 * platforms feel the same.
 *
 * This is *strictly* an affordance — the authoritative policy check is
 * server-side in identity-svc's `evaluatePassword`, which the screens still
 * surface via the `reasons[]` array on a 400 response. Keeping a copy of
 * the rule set on the web/mobile clients in lockstep with the server would
 * require a generated bundle; that's tracked in the long-term hygiene plan.
 *
 * The score is `0..4` where 0 ≈ "very weak" and 4 ≈ "very strong". The
 * `reasons` array uses the same `too_short` / `too_weak` codes the server
 * returns, so the screens can pipe both client- and server-side reasons
 * through a single `reasonText` mapping.
