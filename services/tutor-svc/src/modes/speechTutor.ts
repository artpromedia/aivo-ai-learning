/**
 * Echo — Speech & Language tutor (`@aivo/tutor-sdk` `TutorDefinition`).
 *
 * Echo overlaps Speech Buddy. Speech Buddy owns the bespoke real-time
 * audio agent core (STT, VAD, TTS, dual safety filters). Echo's
 * declarative TutorDefinition runs the *non-audio* pathways — text +
 * image + AAC scaffolds — through the generic runtime. Voice
 * capabilities are declared here so the catalog UI can route audio
 * sessions over to Speech Buddy when appropriate; the consent gate is
 * inherited from Speech Buddy when audio is engaged.
 *
 * Persona / subject-strategy: `ADDON_TUTOR_SPEECH`.
