/**
 * Sprint 8 — district route coverage smoke test.
 *
 * Hits the live identity-svc HTTP surface (the same server the workflow
 * runs) and asserts that every registered `/api/district/*` endpoint
 * rejects an unauthenticated request with 401/403, proving the global
 * tenant-scope hook is in front of all of them.
 *
 * Skips silently if the service isn't reachable so this test runs
 * cleanly in CI environments that don't boot the full stack.
